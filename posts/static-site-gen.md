At Creativitas.dev, we're huge advocates for static site generators (SSGs) like Jekyll, Eleventy, and Astro.js[1][2]. These powerful tools offer numerous benefits for modern web development:

1. Lightning-fast load times
2. Improved security
3. Simplified hosting and deployment
4. Excellent developer experience

Our team has extensive experience with various SSGs, allowing us to choose the perfect solution for your project. Whether you need a simple blog or a complex documentation site, we can help you harness the power of static site generation.
